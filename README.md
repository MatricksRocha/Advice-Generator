## üìï About

This website was created as a study challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). Basically, this is a website where the user can click on the dice to generate an advice on the screen.

My main objective with this challenge was to start to learn about how to consume an API in a real project and also keep improving my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills.

## üíª Executing the Project

To execute the project in your computer:

```bash
# Clone the project
$ git clone https://github.com/MatricksRocha/Advice-Generator.git
```

To run the project you need to have live-server on your computer. You can install the Live Server extension on Visual Studio Code or install live-server using npm. Using the terminal you will have 2 options: install it only on the root folder of the project or install it globally on your computer (the 2nd option means that the live-server will be available everywhere on your computer).

<strong><u>Using Live Server Extension on VS Code:</u></strong>

To use live-server extension on Visual Studio Code, install the extension using the link below and open the "index.html" file with Live Server: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer

<strong><u>Using npm:</u></strong>

```bash
# To install live-server only on the root folder of the project, go to the root folder and run:
$ npm install live-server
```

Or

```bash
# To install live-server globally on your computer:
$ npm install live-server -g
```

```bash
# With live-server installed, you need to start the live-server on the root folder of the project by running:
$ npx live-server
```
